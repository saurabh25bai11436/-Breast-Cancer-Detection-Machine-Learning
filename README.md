# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Machine-Learning
Detecting Breast Cancer using different ML Agorithm &amp; Techniques.

This project implements a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant(non-cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. It aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool to assist in medical diagnostics.

#  About The Project
Breast cancer is one of the most fatal cancers among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to analyze digitized features of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and predict whether the tumor is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1.Data Exploration & Visualization
2.Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Feature scaling)
3.Model Training & Evaluation (Comparing multiple classifiers)
4.Hyperparameter Tuning
5.Saving the best model for future use.
